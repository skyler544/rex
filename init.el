;;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;
;; Welcome to rex! This Emacs configuration is intended to be simple
;; to understand and extend. Emphasis is placed on the use of well-
;; documented, modular packages. Configuration is aided and organized
;; via use-package. Key bindings are defined with general.el.
;;
;; Each use-package block should contain configuration for a single
;; package and should be entirely standalone. Disabling a use-package
;; block should not break the operation of any other package. This is
;; not always entirely feasible, but the effort should be made.
;;
;; Configuration for specific areas-of-concern should be done within a
;; standalone file inside the config/ directory. Such files may then
;; be explicitly loaded here. Disabling a file by removing or
;; commenting out the line that loads it should not break the rest of
;; the configuration. One exception is the bootstrap file; without it,
;; use-package will not be loaded and none of the rest of the
;; configuration will work.
